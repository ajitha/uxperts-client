# UxpertsClient

## Development server

To run the mock backend, `cd mock-server` and `npm run start`. This is only for testing purposes.
If the question contains the word 'expert' in it, mock server returns a response with expert user objects. Otherwise it will return a plain string. See index.js

To run the client `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
